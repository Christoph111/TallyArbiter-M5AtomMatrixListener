# TallyArbiter-M5AtomMatrixListener
This is a Tally Viewer using a M5 Atom Matrix.
At some point I will write a guide for how to install this on the M5 ATOM Matrix devices.
Next Update will have Internal Motion Unit functionality to automatically rotate the screen.
Thanks to mg-1999 for the code base, and huge thanks to josephdadams for his amazing work on TallyArbiter
